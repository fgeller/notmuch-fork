    """Represents a list of notmuch threads

    This object provides an iterator over a list of notmuch threads
    (Technically, it provides a wrapper for the underlying
    *notmuch_threads_t* structure). Do note that the underlying
    library only provides a one-time iterator (it cannot reset the
    iterator to the start). Thus iterating over the function will
    "exhaust" the list of threads, and a subsequent iteration attempt
    will raise a :exc:`NotmuchError` STATUS.NOT_INITIALIZED. Also
    note, that any function that uses iteration will also
    exhaust the messages. So both::

      for thread in threads: print thread

    as well as::

       number_of_msgs = len(threads)

    will "exhaust" the threads. If you need to re-iterate over a list of
    messages you will need to retrieve a new :class:`Threads` object.

    Things are not as bad as it seems though, you can store and reuse
    the single Thread objects as often as you want as long as you
    keep the parent Threads object around. (Recall that due to
    hierarchical memory allocation, all derived Threads objects will
    be invalid when we delete the parent Threads() object, even if it
    was already "exhausted".) So this works::

      db   = Database()
      threads = Query(db,'').search_threads() #get a Threads() object
      threadlist = []
      for thread in threads:
         threadlist.append(thread)

      # threads is "exhausted" now and even len(threads) will raise an
      # exception.
      # However it will be kept around until all retrieved Thread() objects are
      # also deleted. If you did e.g. an explicit del(threads) here, the
      # following lines would fail.

      # You can reiterate over *threadlist* however as often as you want.
      # It is simply a list with Thread objects.

      print (threadlist[0].get_thread_id())
      print (threadlist[1].get_thread_id())
      print (threadlist[0].get_total_messages())
