    This object contains the Filenames iterator. The main function is

    iterator over a list of notmuch filenames. Do note that the underlying
    library only provides a one-time iterator (it cannot reset the iterator to
    the start). Thus iterating over the function will "exhaust" the list of
    tags, and a subsequent iteration attempt will raise a :exc:`NotmuchError`
    STATUS.NOT_INITIALIZED. Also note, that any function that uses iteration
    (nearly all) will also exhaust the tags. So both::

      for name in filenames: print name

    as well as::

       number_of_names = len(names)

    and even a simple::

       #str() iterates over all tags to construct a space separated list
       print(str(filenames))

    will "exhaust" the Filenames. However, you can use
    :meth:`Message.get_filenames` repeatedly to get fresh Filenames
    objects to perform various actions on filenames.
