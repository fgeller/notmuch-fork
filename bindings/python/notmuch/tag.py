    This object provides an iterator over a list of notmuch tags (which

    iterator (it cannot reset the iterator to the start). Thus iterating
    over the function will "exhaust" the list of tags, and a subsequent
    iteration attempt will raise a :exc:`NotmuchError`
    STATUS.NOT_INITIALIZED. Also note, that any function that uses
    iteration (nearly all) will also exhaust the tags. So both::

      for tag in tags: print tag

    as well as::

       number_of_tags = len(tags)

    and even a simple::

       #str() iterates over all tags to construct a space separated list
       print(str(tags))

    will "exhaust" the Tags. If you need to re-iterate over a list of
    tags you will need to retrieve a new :class:`Tags` object.
